Mancala, a game played on a board with two rows of six holes each, involves setting up 48 markers, typically stones or marbles, with four in each of the 12 holes. Each player has a store on their right side. The game starts with a player selecting a hole and distributing its stones counter-clockwise, one in each hole until they run out.

Here are the key gameplay rules:
1. When distributing stones, if you reach your own store, place a stone in it. Skip the opponent's store.
2. If the last stone lands in your store, you earn an extra turn.
3. If the last stone lands in an empty hole on your side, you capture that stone along with any stones in the opposite hole.
4. All captured stones go into your store.

The game ends when one side of the board is empty. The player with remaining pieces on their side captures those pieces. Count all stones in each player's store, and the player with the most stones wins.

Strategic planning, considering future moves, is crucial for success in Mancala.
