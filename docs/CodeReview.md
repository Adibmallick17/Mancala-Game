* Functionality and Correctness:

1. Meaningful Variable and Method Names:
Variable and method names are mostly descriptive but could be improved for clarity and consistency. For instance, in the MancalaGame class, the pits and stores arrays might benefit from more descriptive names like playerPits and playerStores.
Additionally, method names like startNewGame() could be clearer, perhaps initializeGame() or resetGame() to better represent their purpose.

2. Coding Conventions and Formatting:
The code generally follows Java conventions, such as using appropriate camelCase for method names and PascalCase for class names.
However, the indentation is inconsistent in some places, such as in the Board class's methods.
Imports are properly used, and static members are not extensively used but could be applied where appropriate, like utility methods.

3. Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is partially maintained, but improvement is possible. For example, in the Player class, direct access to the store variable could be restricted by providing access through methods.
Getters and setters exist for some properties but are missing in other classes, hindering encapsulation and proper data access.

4. Code Duplication:
There doesn't seem to be significant code duplication within the provided snippets. However, common functionalities like initializing the board or checking for game over could potentially be extracted into utility methods.

5. Responsibilities and Method Length:
The responsibilities of classes and methods seem reasonable, focusing on specific game-related functionalities.
However, some methods might benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, especially in the MancalaGame class, where the move() method could potentially handle multiple responsibilities.


* Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Naming Clarity: Refactor variable and method names for clearer and more consistent understanding.

2. Formatting Consistency: Ensure consistent indentation and code formatting throughout the classes.

3. Encapsulation Enhancement: Review and improve encapsulation by limiting direct access to class variables and providing proper getters and setters where necessary.

4. Code Modularity: Consider extracting common functionalities into separate methods to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

5. Method Length: Break down longer methods, especially in the MancalaGame class, into smaller, focused methods for better readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code provides a functional structure for a Mancala game, but improvements in naming, formatting, encapsulation, and code modularity could enhance its readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
